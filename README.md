# kmeans-clustering
This code is a simple example of how to use k-means clustering in R to create audience segments based on a survey dataset, in this case using data from the Pew Research Center. 

To download the dataset on which this code runs you will need to create a free account at Pew Research Center and download the data from the American Trends Panel Wave 111 page: https://www.pewresearch.org/dataset/american-trends-panel-wave-111/

The script contains two example visualizations using ggplot but many more could be created based on the dimensions available in the survey data either using ggplot or by exporting the clustered dataset to Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, ChatGPT or another visualization tool.

A broader explanation of the process of segmenting audiences for marketing that includes use of the code in this repository is available on my LinkedIn page here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-burghes-6ba66a1/overlay/1716524641639/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAABGhW4B9eiAJ4tt4LT-EDCv5E3gROmRO58
